##What is the difference between Git and Github?

**Git** is a version control system to manage and keep track of the source code history. 

**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service to manage Git repositories. 
If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. 
Both git and github give programmers version controlling tools and functions to allow the smooth coding and building of projects. But yeah, getting deeper into the functionality of both, it is seem that github provides a much wider range of functions going ahead few steps than github.
