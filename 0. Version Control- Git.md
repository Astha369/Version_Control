<h1>Version Control</h1>

**About**
*Problems encountered in an organistion or during a project building:*
- Collaboration with other users or developers around the globe.
- Storing versions i.e the project is developed on multiple versions on different platforms.
- Restoring previous versions i.e going back to previous versions to figure the problems.
- Figuring the process i.e what has changes have been made.
- Backup problem. 

That's when the versin control system comes in action. All these can be solved using *Version Control System*

*Version control* is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It ensures that many people can work simultaneously on the latest version of the same project.
