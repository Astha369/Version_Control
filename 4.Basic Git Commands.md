<h1>Basic Git Commands</h1>

**Introduction**

While working on Git, we actively use two repositories. 

- Local repository:
The local repository is present on our computer and consists of all the files and
folders.This Repository is used to make changes locally, review history, and commit when
offline.

- Remote repository:
The remote repository refers to the server repository that may be present anywhere. This
repository is used by all the team members to exchange the changes made.

Both repositories have their own set of commands. There are separate Git Commands that work
on different types of repositories<br><br><br>



<h3>Git Commands: Working With Local Repositories</h3><br><br>

**git init**

-The command git init is used to create an empty Git repository. 

-After the git init command is used, a .git folder is created in the directory with some
subdirectories. Once the repository is initialized, the process of creating other files
begins.

 **git add**

-Add command is used after checking the status of the files, to add those files to the staging area.

-Before running the commit command, "git add" is used to add any new or modified files.

 **git commit**

-The commit command makes sure that the changes are saved to the local repository.
-The command "git commit â€“m <message>" allows you to describe everyone and help them understand what has happened. 
 <br><br>

**git status**

-The git status command tells the current state of the repository.
-The command provides the current working branch. If the files are in the staging area, but not committed, it will be shown by the git status. Also, if there are no changes, it will show the message no changes to commit, working directory clean.

**git config**

-The git config command is used initially to configure the user.name and user.email. This specifies what email id and username will be used from a local repository.
-When git config is used with --global flag, it writes the settings to all repositories on the computer.
 <br><br>

**git branch**

-The git branch command is used to determine what branch the local repository is on.
-The command enables adding and deleting a branch.
 
# Create a new branch
  git branch <branch_name>

# List all remote or local branches
  git branch -a

# Delete a branch
  git branch -d <branch_name>
<br><br>
**git checkout**

-The git checkout command is used to switch branches, whenever the work is to be started on a different branch.
-The command works on three separate entities: files, commits, and branches.
# Checkout an existing branch
  git checkout <branch_name>

# Checkout and create a new branch with that name
  git checkout -b <new_branch>

**git merge**

-The git merge command is used to integrate the branches together. The command combines the changes from one branch to another branch. 
-It is used to merge the changes in the staging branch to the stable branch.
