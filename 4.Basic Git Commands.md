<h1>Basic Git Commands</h1>

**Introduction**

While working on Git, we actively use two repositories. 

- Local repository:
The local repository is present on our computer and consists of all the files and
folders.This Repository is used to make changes locally, review history, and commit when
offline.

- Remote repository:
The remote repository refers to the server repository that may be present anywhere. This
repository is used by all the team members to exchange the changes made.

Both repositories have their own set of commands. There are separate Git Commands that work
on different types of repositories

<h3>**Git Commands: Working With Local Repositories**</h3>

*git init*

-The command git init is used to create an empty Git repository. 

-After the git init command is used, a .git folder is created in the directory with some
subdirectories. Once the repository is initialized, the process of creating other files
begins.
